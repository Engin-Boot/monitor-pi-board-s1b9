# Building Qt GUI Application

## Qt5 Installation

* [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer?hsCtaTracking=99d9dd4f-5681-48d2-b096-470725510d34%7C074ddad0-fdef-4e53-8aa8-5e8a876d6ab4)

* [Qt Offline Installer](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/) (Recommended).

You can use anyone of the above installers to install Qt and develop GUI applications.

### I.  Parsing JSON report created by the [Core-Infra Team](https://github.com/Engin-Boot/monitor-pi-board-s1b11)

Access the JSON report file in Qt using QFile.

As the JSON report has 2 Keys, the package name and version so the content of JSON report in 2 variables of type [QStringList](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstringlist.html#:~:text=QStringListIterator-,Detailed%20Description,is%20both%20fast%20and%20safe.).

### II. GUI Interface to display the contents from JSON

The interface depends on accessing required elements from the backend C++ code.

The QStringList variables containing package names and versions are exposed using Q_PROPERTY. Then they are used as model parameters in two separate ListViews.
The two ListViews have a common ScrollBar to view the final table.

### III. Results

### IV. Build and Run from Git repo

* Make sure Qt5 is installed on your system.

* Clone this repo to your local system.

* Open the .pro file with QtCreator and edit the path to get packages in main.qml to your JSON file location. Alternatively, rename your JSON file as package-json-report.json and replace the existing one in segment2 folder.

* Build and Run with green arrow.
